# Optimization Workshops

This code is part of the series about performance in the .NET. The aim of the
series is about learning how to measure performance, how to find bottlenecks
and how to fix them. The series is divided in the following parts:

## Workshop 1: Measuring Performance

This part introduces users to the theoretical concepts of performance measurement
and the tools available in .NET to measure performance.

## Workshop 2: .NET Memory Management - Garbage Collector

This part introduces users to the theoretical concepts of the .NET Garbage Collector
along with the code that shows how garbage collection works in practise.

## Workshop 3: .NET Memory Management - Structs & Strings

Workshop introduces concepts of the structs and strings in .NET and the best ways to work with 
them to keep allocations under control.

## Workshop 4: .NET Memory Management - Span/Memory & Pooling

Last workshop about memory management in .NET, it introduces concept of pooling
to optimize memory usage in the application. 

## Workshop 5: Collections in .NET

Introduction to the .NET collections and how to use them in order to achieve 
optimal application performance.

## Workshop 6: Parallel programming in .NET

Overview of parallel programming in .NET, how to speed up processing using multiple
threads and when parallel processing can be a bad idea. 

## Workshop 7: Asynchronous programming in .NET

Workshop about asynchronous programming in .NET, how does it work under the hood,
when it should be used and avoided.

## Workshop 8: Code generation in .NET

Look into dynamic code generation during runtime and compile time and how to use
it to improve application performance.
